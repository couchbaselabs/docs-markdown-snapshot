# collect-logs-status

Get log collection status

## [](#synopsis)SYNOPSIS

_couchbase-cli collect-logs-status_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>] [--password <password>]
    [--client-cert <path>] [--client-cert-password <password>] [--client-key <path>]
    [--client-key-password <password>]

## [](#description)DESCRIPTION

This command is used to check the status of the log collection task that is either currently running or last completed. This command is especially useful since it lists the exact location of the collected files on each node. Upon a successful run of this command the output will either be one of the two messages below.

No log collection tasks were found

or

Status: <running | cancelled | completed>
Details:
  Node: <node name>
  Status: <started | collected>
  path: <path to the location of the collected logs>

If logs for multiple nodes were collected, then multiple nodes will be listed in the details section.

## [](#options)OPTIONS

\-c

\--cluster

Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS section for more information about specifying a hostname.

\-u

\--username <username>

Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error.

\-p

\--password <password>

Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is given then the command will prompt the user for a password through non-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the environment variable CB\_REST\_PASSWORD.

\--client-cert <path>

The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a cluster. May be supplied with `--client-key` as an alternative to the `--username` and `--password` flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.

\--client-cert-password <password>

The password for the certificate provided to the `--client-cert` flag, when using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12 format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.

\--client-key <path>

The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the certificate provided to the `--client-cert` flag. May be supplied with `--client-cert` as an alternative to the `--username` and `--password`flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.

\--client-key-password <password>

The password for the key provided to the `--client-key` flag, when using this flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.

## [](#host-formats)HOST FORMATS

When specifying a host for the couchbase-cli command the following formats are expected:

* `couchbase://<addr>` or `couchbases://<addr>`
* `http://<addr>:<port>` or `https://<addr>:<port>`
* `<addr>:<port>`

It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> or couchbases://<addr> format for standard installations. The other formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091 (or 18091 for https).

## [](#certificate-authentication-mtls-authentication)CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)

This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently multiple ways this may be done.

### [](#pem-encoded-certificatekey)PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY

An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using: - `--client-cert <path>`\- `--client-key <path>`

The file passed to `--client-cert` must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate the client certificate.

The file passed to `--client-key` must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats: - PKCS#1 - PKCS#8

Currently, only the following key types are supported: - RSA - DSA

### [](#pem-encoded-certificatepem-or-der-encrypted-pkcs8-key)PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/PEM OR DER ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY

An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using: - `--client-cert <path>`\- `--client-key <path>`\- `--client-key-password <password>`

The file passed to `--client-cert` must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate the client certificate.

Currently, only the following key types are supported: - RSA - DSA

### [](#encrypted-pkcs12-certificatekey)ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY

An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using: - `--client-cert <path>`\- `--client-cert-password <password>`

The file passed to `--client-cert` must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.

Currently, only the following key types are supported: - RSA - DSA

## [](#examples)EXAMPLES

To see the status of a running or completed log collection task run the command below.

$ couchbase-cli collect-logs-status -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
 --password password

Status: completed
Details:
  Node: n_0@192.168.1.5
  Status: collected
  path: /opt/enterprise-analytics/var/lib/couchbase/tmp/collectinfo-2016-09-27T005502-n_0@192.168.1.5.zip

## [](#environment-and-configuration-variables)ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

CB\_REST\_USERNAME

Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the -u/--username argument on the command line.

CB\_REST\_PASSWORD

Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the -p/--password argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their password are not cached in their command line history.

CB\_CLIENT\_CERT

The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a cluster. May be supplied with `CB_CLIENT_KEY` as an alternative to the `CB_USERNAME` and `CB_PASSWORD` variables. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.

CB\_CLIENT\_CERT\_PASSWORD

The password for the certificate provided to the `CB_CLIENT_CERT` variable, when using this variable, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12 format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.

CB\_CLIENT\_KEY

The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the certificate provided to the `CB_CLIENT_CERT` variable. May be supplied with `CB_CLIENT_CERT` as an alternative to the `CB_USERNAME` and `CB_PASSWORD`variables. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.

CB\_CLIENT\_KEY\_PASSWORD

The password for the key provided to the `CB_CLIENT_KEY` variable, when using this variable, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
