# Client Settings

> Client settings. 

## [](#io-options)I/O Options

This section provides basic settings that will come in handy while configuring network related operations.

Name: **DNS SRV Timeout**

Connection String Option: `enable_dns_srv`

Default: `true`

Gets the bootstrap node list from a DNS SRV record. See the Connection Management section for more information on how to use it properly.

Name: **Mutation Tokens Enabled**

Connection String Options: `enable_mutation_tokens`

Default: `true`

Mutation tokens allow enhanced durability requirements as well as advanced SQL++ (formerly N1QL) querying capabilities. Set this to `false` if you do not require these features and wish to avoid the associated overhead.

Name: **Socket Keepalive**

Connection String Option: `enable_tcp_keep_alive`

Default: `true`

If enabled, the client periodically sends a TCP keepalive to the server to prevent firewalls and other network equipment from dropping idle TCP connections.

Name: **Socket Keepalive Interval**

Connection String Option: `tcp_keep_alive_interval`

Default: `60000ms`

The idle time after which a TCP keepalive gets fired. (This setting has no effect if `enable_tcp_keep_alive` is `false`.)

> [!NOTE]
> This setting only propagates to the OS on Linux when the epoll transport is used. On all other platforms, the OS-configured time is used (and you need to tune it there if you want to override the default interval).

Name: **Config Poll Interval**

Cluster Option: `config_poll_interval`

Default: `2500ms`

The interval at which the client fetches cluster topology information in order to proactively detect changes.

## [](#timeout-options)Timeout Options

The default timeout values are suitable for most environments, and should be adjusted only after profiling the expected latencies in your deployment environment. If you get a timeout exception, it may be a symptom of another issue; increasing the timeout duration is sometimes not the best long-term solution.

Most timeouts can be overridden on a per-operation basis (for example, by passing a custom options block to a "get" or "query" method). The values set here are used as the defaults when no per-operation timeout is specified.

The cluster-wide timeouts might be changed using connection string in milliseconds.

```ruby
couchbase://localhost?query_timeout=10000
```

### [](#timeout-options-reference)Timeout Options Reference

Name: **Key-Value Timeout**

Connection String Option: `kv_timeout`

Default: `2500ms` _but see TIP, below_

The Key/Value default timeout is used on operations which are performed on a specific key if not overridden by a custom timeout. This includes all commands like `get`, `lookup_in` and all mutation commands, but does not include operations that are performed with enhanced durability requirements.

> [!TIP]
> [Durable Write operations](../concept-docs/durability-replication-failure-considerations.md#synchronous-writes)have their own timeout setting, `kv_durable_timeout`, see below.

Name: **Key-Value Durable Operation Timeout**

Connection String Option: `kv_durable_timeout`

Default: `10000ms`

Key/Value operations with enhanced durability requirements may take longer to complete, so they have a separate default timeout.

**Do not** set this above 65s, which is the maximum possible `SyncWrite` timeout on the Server side.

> [!WARNING]
> The `kv_durable_timeout` property is not part of the stable API and may change or be removed at any time.

Name: **View Timeout**

Connection String Option: `view_timeout`

Default: `75000ms`

The View timeout is used on view operations if not overridden by a custom timeout. Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value since it can affect hundreds or thousands of rows. Also, if there is a node failure during the request the internal cluster timeout is set to 60 seconds.

Name: **Query Timeout**

Connection String Option: `query_timeout`

Default: `75000ms`

The Query timeout is used on all SQL++ query operations if not overridden by a custom timeout. Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value since it can affect hundreds or thousands of rows.

Name: **Search Timeout**

Connection String Option: `search_timeout`

Default: `75000ms`

The Search timeout is used on all FTS operations if not overridden by a custom timeout. Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value since it can affect hundreds or thousands of rows.

Name: **Analytics Timeout**

Connection String Option: `analytics_timeout`

Default: `75000ms`

The Analytics timeout is used on all Analytics query operations if not overridden by a custom timeout. Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value since it can affect hundreds or thousands of rows.

Name: **Management Timeout**

Connection String Option: `management_timeout`

Default: `75000s`

The management timeout is used on all cluster management APIs (BucketManager, UserManager, CollectionManager, QueryIndexManager, etc.) if not overridden by a custom timeout. The default is quite high because some operations (such as flushing a bucket, for example) might take a long time.

## [](#general-options)General Options

Name: **Unordered Execution**

Cluster Option: `enable_unordered_execution`

Default: `true`

From Couchbase 7.0, Out-of-Order execution allows the server to concurrently handle multiple requests on the same connection, potentially improving performance for durable writes and multi-document ACID transactions. This means that tuning the number of connections (KV endpoints) is no longer necessary as a workaround where data not available in the cache is causing timeouts.

This is set to true by default. Note, changing the setting will only affect Server versions 7.0 onwards.

## [](#commonly-used-options)Commonly Used Options

The defaults above have been carefully considered and in general it is not recommended to make changes without expert guidance or careful testing of the change. Some options may be commonly used together in certain envionments or to achieve certain effects.

### [](#constrained-network-environments)Constrained Network Environments

Though [wide area network](../project-docs/compatibility.md#network-requirements) (WAN) connections are not directly supported, some development and non-critical operations activities across a WAN are convenient. Most likely for connecting to Couchbase Capella, or Server running in your own cloud account, whilst developing from a laptop or other machine not located in the same data center. These settings are some you may want to consider adjusting:

* Connect Timeout to 30s
* Key-Value Timeout to 5s
* Config Poll Interval to 10s
* Circuit Breaker ErrorThresholdPercentage to 75

> [!NOTE]
> As of SDK API 3.4 you can also use a **Configuration Profile**, which allows you to quickly configure your environment for common use-cases. See the [Configuration Profiles](#configuration-profiles) section for more details.

## [](#configuration-profiles)Configuration Profiles

Configuration Profiles provide predefined client settings that allow you to quickly configure an environment for common use-cases. When using a configuration profile, the current client settings are overridden with the values provided in the profile. Any property that is not specified in the profile is left unchanged.

> [!CAUTION]
> The Configuration Profiles feature is currently a [Volatile API](../../current/project-docs/compatibility.md#interface-stability) and may be subject to change.

### [](#wan-development)WAN Development

**Cluster Option:** `apply_profile("wan_development")`

A `wan_development` configuration profile can be used to modify client settings for development or high-latency environments. This profile changes the default timeouts.
