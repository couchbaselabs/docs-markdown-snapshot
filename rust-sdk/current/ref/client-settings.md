# Client Settings

> The `ClusterOptions` struct enables you to configure Rust SDK options for bootstrapping, reliability, and performance. 

Almost all configuration for the SDK can be specified through the `ClusterOptions` which are passed to the `Cluster::connect` call in the SDK. In addition to this, some of these options can also be specified through the connection string.

Most of the Cluster Options are grouped into categories. For example, TLS options are configured using an instance of the `TlsOptions` struct, accessed via the `ClusterOptions` instance’s `tls_options()` getter.

Configuring TLS options

```rust
ClusterOptions::new(Authenticator::PasswordAuthenticator(
    PasswordAuthenticator::new("username".to_string(), "password".to_string()),
))
.tls_options(TlsOptions::new());
```

## [](#general-options)General Options

These options specify the general configuration options for the client.

Name: **Authenticator**

Options Method: `ClusterOptions` constructor parameter

Set this to the authenticator you wish to use to authenticate with the server. Possible options which are included in the SDK include the `PasswordAuthenticator` and `CertificateAuthenticator`.

## [](#compression-options)Compression Options

The client can compress documents before sending them to Couchbase Server.

Name: **Enabling Compression**

Options Method: `compression_mode(CompressionMode)`

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: `CompressionMode::Enabled { min_size: 32, min_ratio: 0.83 }`

If set to `CompressionMode::Disabled`, the client will never compress documents, regardless of their size or compressibility. If set to `CompressionMode::Enabled`, the client may compress documents before they are sent to Couchbase Server.

Name: **Document Minimum Size**

Options Method: `compression_mode(CompressionMode::Enabled { min_size, .. })`

Default: `32`

Size in bytes. Documents smaller than this size are never compressed.

Name: **Document Minimum Compressibility**

Options Method: `compression_mode(CompressionMode::Enabled { .., min_ratio })`

Default: `0.83`

A floating point value between 0 and 1\. Specifies how "compressible" a document must be in order for the compressed form to be sent to the server.

> [!TIP]
> Increasing the value allows compression to be used with less-compressible documents.

If the compressed document size divided by the uncompressed document size is greater than this value, then the uncompressed version of the document will be sent to Couchbase Server instead of the compressed version.

For example, with a `min_ratio` of `0.83`, compression will only be used if the size of the compressed document is less than 83% of the uncompressed document size.

## [](#tls-options)TLS Options

By default, the client will connect to (self-managed) Couchbase Server using an unencrypted connection. If you are using the Enterprise Edition of self-managed Couchbase Server, it’s possible to secure the connection using TLS.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless you use the `couchbases://` connection string scheme, none of the other security settings in this section have any effect. If you are using Capella, secure connection is the only option.

Name: **TLS Certificates**

Options Method: `TlsOptions::add_ca_certificate` / `TlsOptions::add_ca_certificates`

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: N/A

Specifies certificates to trust as Certificate Authorities when establishing secure connections. One or more CA certificates can be added depending on the TLS backend in use (`rustls` or `native-tls`) specified using Cargo features.

With the `rustls` backend, certificates are provided as `CertificateDer<'static>`. With the `native-tls` backend, certificates are provided as `tokio_native_tls::native_tls::Certificate`.

Name: **Dangerously Accept Invalid Certificates**

Options Method: `TlsOptions::danger_accept_invalid_certs(bool)`

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: `false`

If set to `true`, the client will accept self-signed or otherwise invalid server certificates. This option should only be used for testing and development, never in production.

Name: **Dangerously Accept Invalid Hostnames**

Options Method: `TlsOptions::danger_accept_invalid_hostnames(bool)` (only available with the `native-tls` backend)

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: `false`

If set to `true`, the client will not validate that the server certificate’s hostname matches the endpoint being connected to. This option should only be used for testing and development, never in production.

## [](#tcp-options)TCP Options

These options control TCP-level behavior for the client.

Name: **TCP Keep-Alive Time**

Options Method: `ClusterOptions::tcp_keep_alive_time(Duration)`

Connection String Parameter: `tcp_keep_alive_time=<duration>`

Default: `60s`

Specifies the duration for TCP keep-alive messages. If set, the client will send keep-alive messages at the given interval to maintain the connection to the server.

## [](#poller-options)Poller Options

These options control the behavior of the SDK’s internal event pollers.

Name: **Configuration Poll Interval**

Options Method: `PollerOptions::config_poll_interval(Duration)`

Connection String Parameter: `config_poll_interval=<duration>`

Default: `2.5s`

The interval at which the client fetches cluster topology information in order to proactively detect changes.

## [](#http-options)HTTP Options

These options control the behavior of HTTP requests made by the SDK.

Name: **Max Idle Connections per Host**

Options Method: `HttpOptions::max_idle_connections_per_host(usize)`

Connection String Parameter: `max_idle_http_connections_per_host=<value>`

Default: `None`

The upper bound on the number of HTTP connections per host.

Name: **Idle Connection Timeout**

Options Method: `HttpOptions::idle_connection_timeout(Duration)`

Connection String Parameter: `idle_http_connection_timeout=<duration>`

Default: `None`

The length of time an HTTP connection may remain idle before it is closed and removed from the pool. Durations longer than 1 second are not recommended, since Couchbase Server aggressively drops idle connections.

## [](#key-value-kv-options)Key-Value (KV) Options

These options control the behavior of key-value operations.

Name: **Enable Mutation Tokens**

Options Method: `KvOptions::enable_mutation_tokens(bool)`

Connection String Parameter: `enable_mutation_tokens=<true|false>`

Default: `true`

Mutation tokens allow enhanced durability requirements as well as advanced SQL++ querying capabilities. Set this to false if you do not require these features and wish to avoid the associated overhead.

Name: **Enable Server Durations**

Options Method: `KvOptions::enable_server_durations(bool)`

Connection String Parameter: `enable_server_durations=<true|false>`

Default: `true`

If `true`, the client will capture the server-side duration of KV operations in the response.

Name: **Number of Connections**

Options Method: `KvOptions::num_connections(usize)`

Connection String Parameter: `num_kv_connections=<value>`

Default: `1`

The number of actual endpoints (sockets) to open per node in the cluster against the Key/Value service. By default, for every node in the cluster one socket is opened where all traffic is pushed through. That way the SDK implicitly benefits from network batching characteristics when the workload increases. If you suspect based on profiling and benchmarking that the socket is saturated you can think about slightly increasing it to have more "parallel pipelines". This might be especially helpful if you need to push large documents through it. The recommendation is keeping it at 1 unless there is other evidence.

Name: **Connect Timeout**

Options Method: `KvOptions::connect_timeout(Duration)`

Connection String Parameter: `kv_connect_timeout=<duration>`

Default: `10s`

The connect timeout is used when a Bucket is opened and if not overridden by a custom timeout. If you feel the urge to change this value to something higher, there is a good chance that your network is not properly set up. Connecting to the server should in practice not take longer than a second on a reasonably fast network.

Name: **Connect Throttle Timeout**

Options Method: `KvOptions::connect_throttle_timeout(Duration)`

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: `5s`

The throttle timeout defines the minimum interval between consecutive connection attempts after a connection error.

## [](#orphan-reporter-options)Orphan Reporter Options

These options control reporting of orphaned operations.

Name: **Enabled**

Options Method: `OrphanReporterOptions::enabled(bool)`

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: `true`

Enable or disable orphan reporting.

Name: **Reporter Interval**

Options Method: `OrphanReporterOptions::reporter_interval(Duration)`

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: `10s`

Specifies how often orphaned operations are reported.

Name: **Sample Size**

Options Method: `OrphanReporterOptions::sample_size(usize)`

Connection String Parameter: N/A

Default: `10`

Specifies the number of orphaned operations to report in each report interval.
