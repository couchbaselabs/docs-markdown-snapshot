# Setting Up Couchbase Rust SDK with rustup

> Discover how to get up and running developing applications with the Couchbase Rust SDK — for those less familiar with Rust. 

A simple Rust orientation intro for \_non-\_Rust folk who are evaluating the Couchbase Rust SDK.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Is This Page for You?
> 
> This page is to help evaluate the Couchbase Rust SDK, if Rust is not where you spend the majority of your working day. It is aimed at Software Architects, QE folk, managers, and anyone else who needs to run through using the Rust SDK without necessarily being comfortable with installing and developing with Rust. If this is not you, head back to the [rest of the Couchbase Rust SDK documentation](overview.md).

## [](#installing)Installing

First thing is to get up and running with a Rust environment. This is done with `rustup`, which allows you to switch between versions, and try out nightly builds, as well as stable and beta releases.

These instructions apply to MacOS and to GNU/Linux. Windows use is beyond the scope of this guide — please see [the Rust site](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html).

### [](#rustup)Rustup

Installing the Rust Language

```console
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you've installed `rustup` in the past, you can update it with:

```console
$ rustup update
```

### [](#c-compiler)C Compiler

You will need a linker — which you most likely have installed already — and a C compiler, as several crates (Rust packages) depend on C code.

For Ubuntu, these packages are usually installed as part of `build-essentials`. Otherwise, install your distribution's prefered C compiler — usually `gcc`, but it may be `clang`.

On OSX:

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

### [](#path)PATH

The Rust toolchain — including `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup` — will be installed to the `~/.cargo/bin` directory. You will want to add this to your `$PATH` (using your platform's preferred place for environmental variables, such as `.bashrc`).

Once you've add to your path, restart the console, and test the installation with:

```console
$ rustc --version
```

Which should return something like:

```console
rustc 1.94.0 (4a4ef493e 2026-03-02)
```

Now [install the SDK](../project-docs/sdk-full-installation.md) or try our [Quickstart Guide](start-using-sdk.md).

## [](#further-help)Further Help

One of the best introductions to Rust programming is [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html), by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho (with contributions from the Rust Community).
