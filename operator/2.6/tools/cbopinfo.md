# cbopinfo

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `cbopinfo` binary is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please use the [cao](cao.md) binary that features all the same functionality under the `cao collect-logs` subcommand.

## [](#installation)Installation

Make sure that you have downloaded the Operator [package](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads) and unpacked it on the same computer where you normally run `kubectl` or `oc`.

After you unpack the download, the resulting directory will be titled something like `couchbase-autonomous-operator-kubernetes_x.x.x-linux_x86_64`.

* macOS
* Linux
* Windows

1. Open a Terminal window and go to the directory where the `cbopinfo` binary is located:  
```console  
$ cd couchbase-autonomous-operator-kubernetes_x.x.x-macos_x86_64/bin/  
```
2. Make the `cbopinfo` binary executable:  
```console  
$ chmod +x ./cbopinfo  
```
3. Move the binary into your PATH:  
```console  
$ sudo mv ./cbopinfo /usr/local/bin/cbopinfo  
```

> [!NOTE]
> On newer versions of macOS, you may encounter errors such as `cannot execute binary file` when trying to use the tools included in the Autonomous Operator package. If you encounter such an error, you'll need to update your security settings as outlined in Apple's [support article on macOS Gatekeeper](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491). In System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click General. Click the lock and enter your password to make changes. Select App Store and identified developers under the header "Allow apps downloaded from."

1. Open a command prompt and go to the directory where the `cbopinfo` binary is located:  
```console  
$ cd couchbase-autonomous-operator-kubernetes_x.x.x-linux_x86_64/bin/  
```
2. Make the `cbopinfo` binary executable:  
```console  
$ chmod +x ./cbopinfo  
```
3. Move the binary into your PATH:  
```console  
$ sudo mv ./cbopinfo /usr/local/bin/cbopinfo  
```

1. Open a command prompt and go to the directory where the `cbopinfo` binary is located:  
```console  
$ cd couchbase-autonomous-operator-kubernetes_x.x.x-windows_x86_64\bin\  
```
2. Add the `cbopinfo` binary into your PATH.

Log and resource collection for Couchbase Autonomous Operator support.

When you encounter a problem with the Autonomous Operator, our support teams require more than just the last line of the logs to diagnose and, ultimately, resolve the issue quickly.

cbopinfo, in its most basic form, collects all resources associated with the Autonomous Operator and Couchbase clusters in the specified namespace, this includes associated logs and events. Most resource types are filtered, so the tool collects only what is necessary. Where filtering is not possible, all instances of that resource are collected, so it may be desirable to segregate the Autonomous Operator into its own namespace. Secrets, for example, are not filtered, but the tool redacts values, so if your support request relates to TLS, you may need to manually collect these resources and include them in your support request.

### [](#examples)Examples

```console
# Collect operator and all couchbase cluster resources
cbopinfo

# Collect operator and a named cluster's resources
cbopinfo --couchbase-cluster my-cluster

# Collect operator resources and Couchbase Server logs
cbopinfo --collectinfo --collectinfo-collect=all

# Collect operator and system (kube-system) resources
cbopinfo --system

# Collect all known resources, applying no filtering
cbopinfo --all
```
