**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is scaling down.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is scaling down.
* `False`: The cluster is not scaling down.
* `Unknown`: The scaling down status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#upgrading)Upgrading

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is undergoing an upgrade.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is upgrading.
* `False`: The cluster is not upgrading.
* `Unknown`: The upgrade status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#hibernating)Hibernating

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is in hibernation.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is hibernating.
* `False`: The cluster is not hibernating.
* `Unknown`: The hibernation status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#error)Error

**Description:** Indicates that there is an error in the Couchbase cluster.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: There is an error in the cluster.
* `False`: There is no error in the cluster.
* `Unknown`: The error status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#autoscaleready)AutoscaleReady

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is ready for autoscaling.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is ready for autoscaling.
* `False`: The cluster is not ready for autoscaling.
* `Unknown`: The autoscaling readiness of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#synchronized)Synchronized

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is synchronized.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is synchronized.
* `False`: The cluster is not synchronized.
* `Unknown`: The synchronization status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#waitingbetweenmigrations)WaitingBetweenMigrations

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is waiting between migrations.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is waiting between migrations.
* `False`: The cluster is not waiting between migrations.
* `Unknown`: The waiting status between migrations of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#migrating)Migrating

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is migrating.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is migrating.
* `False`: The cluster is not migrating.
* `Unknown`: The migration status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#rebalancing)Rebalancing

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is rebalancing its data across nodes.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is rebalancing.
* `False`: The cluster is not rebalancing.
* `Unknown`: The rebalancing status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#expandingvolume)ExpandingVolume

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster is expanding a volume.

**Possible Values:**

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster is migrating a bucket storage backend.
* `False`: The cluster is not migrating a bucket storage backend.
* `Unknown`: The bucket migration status of the cluster cannot be determined.

### [](#clusterunreconcilable)ClusterUnreconcilable

**Description:** Indicates that the Couchbase cluster spec is invalid and cannot be reconciled.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster spec has failed validation and/or reconciliation cannot be completed.
* `False`: The cluster spec is valid and reconciliation is proceeding normally.
* `Unknown`: The validity of the cluster spec cannot be determined.

### [](#mixedmode)MixedMode

**Description:** The Couchbase cluster is running nodes on two different Couchbase Server versions.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: The cluster contains nodes running different Couchbase Server versions.
* `False`: All nodes in the cluster are running the same Couchbase Server version.
* `Unknown`: The version uniformity of cluster nodes cannot be determined.

### [](#servicesmismatch)ServicesMismatch

**Description:** One or more Couchbase nodes from server classes in the Couchbase cluster are running Couchbase services that do not match the desired services defined in the cluster spec.

**Possible Values:**

* `True`: At least one server class has nodes whose active services differ from the desired services.
* `False`: All server classes are running their desired services.
* `Unknown`: Whether a services mismatch exists cannot be determined.

### [](#manualinterventionrequired)ManualInterventionRequired

**Description:** The Couchbase cluster has encountered a problem that the operator cannot resolve automatically and requires administrator action.
