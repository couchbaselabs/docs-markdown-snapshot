> Prevent Couchbase Server containers from running as root. 

When using Kubernetes all pods are run as root by default. This is a security concern for many enterprises, so they enforce pods be run as a non-root user. By default, Couchbase server pods will change their user to `couchbase` (UID 1000), however performing a `kubectl exec` into a pod still runs as root. This how-to shows how to run as a non-root user in all circumstances.

## [](#couchbase-cluster-configuration)Couchbase Cluster Configuration

Non-root Couchbase Server installs are configured as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: couchbase.com/v2
kind: CouchbaseCluster
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: false (1)
    runAsUser: 1000 (2)
```

| **1** | spec.securityContext.runAsNonRoot is not necessary to function, however illustrates that this field **must** be false. The Couchbase Server container image will be validated by kubelet to ensure it runs as a non-root user account when this is set to true. As the container doesn’t run as a non-root account the validation will fail. |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2** | spec.securityContext.runAsUser is required, and will execute all processes as this user. The value must be 1000 as this maps to the couchbase user within the container image.                                                                                                                                                               |
