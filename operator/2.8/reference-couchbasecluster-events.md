# <code>CouchbaseCluster</code> Events

> Kubernetes events that are raised by the Operator for `CouchbaseCluster` resources. 

Kubernetes can displays extended information about a resource using the `kubectl describe` command. The Operator generated life-cycle events as the cluster is provisioned, edited or repaired. These events may be used for problem determination or as synchronous triggers for external Kubernetes orchestration.

The lifecycle of a `CouchbaseCluster` includes the following events (in no particular order):

## [](#member-lifecycle)Member Lifecycle

MemberCreationFailed

A new member was unable to be created. This may be due to pod scheduling constraints, network issues or TLS configuration.

NewMemberAdded

A new Couchbase node was added to the cluster.

FailedAddNode

A Couchbase node failed to join the cluster.

FailedAddBackNode

A Couchbase node failed to be added back into a cluster after being manually failed over.

MemberRemoved

A Couchbase node was removed from the cluster.

MemberDown

A Couchbase node has been reported as down by its peers.

MemberRecovered

A failed Couchbase node has been recovered from its persistent volume.

MemberFailedOver

A node has either been failed over automatically or manually.

RebalanceStarted

A rebalance operation has started.

RebalanceIncomplete

A rebalance operation has terminated abnormally; nodes may have not been added or ejected as expected.

RebalanceCompleted

A rebalance operation has successfully completed.

ExpandVolumeSucceeded

A volume expansion operation has successfully completed.

ExpandVolumeFallback

A volume expansion operation has failed and the cluster is falling back to a rolling upgrade of volumes.

ExpandVolumeStarted

A volume expansion operation has started.

ReconciliationFailed

A reconciliation operation failed. This may be due to a transient error or a configuration issue.

## [](#cluster-upgrade-lifecycle)Cluster Upgrade Lifecycle

UpgradeStarted

An upgrade operation has started.

UpgradeFinished

An upgrade operation has successfully completed.

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrade events are raised in relation to an upgrade of the entire cluster and not individual nodes. Individual node upgrades will raise `NewMemberAdded`, `RebalanceStarted`, `MemberRemoved` and `RebalanceCompleted` member lifecycle events as members are swapped out for upgraded replacements.
