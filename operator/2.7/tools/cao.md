* Linux
* Windows

1. Open a Terminal window and go to the directory where the `cao` binary is located:  
```console  
$ cd couchbase-autonomous-operator-kubernetes_x.x.x-macos_x86_64/bin/  
```
2. Make the `cao` binary executable:  
```console  
$ chmod +x ./cao  
```
3. Move the binary into your PATH:  
```console  
$ sudo mv ./cao /usr/local/bin/cao  
```

> [!NOTE]
> On newer versions of macOS, you may encounter errors such as `cannot execute binary file` when trying to use the tools included in the Autonomous Operator package. If you encounter such an error, you'll need to update your security settings as outlined in Apple's [support article on macOS Gatekeeper](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491). In System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click General. Click the lock and enter your password to make changes. Select App Store and identified developers under the header "Allow apps downloaded from."

Couchbase Autonomous Operator Utility Tool

## [](#cao-certify-flags)cao certify \[flags\]

Runs the platform certification suite

It's impossible to officially test every combination of Kubernetes platform, CNI and CSI plugin in order to give confidence that your specific combination will work as intended with the Operator. To this end, the certify command will run a platform certification subset of the official Operator tests to give confidence that your plaform will work in a safe and supportable manner with managed Couchbase Server.

The certification process is relatively invasive, so we recommend that this command be executed on a dedicated test Kubernetes cluster and not a production one.

The certification process requires that it be allowed to create and delete namespaces in order to facilitate testing concurrently. It also requires permission to create roles and rolebindings in order to deploy the operator and dynamic admission controller. As such it will not be able to run without cluster wide roles that allow such functionality.

Resource access is scoped so that only couchbase.com CRDs are managed and namespace with the name 'test-\*'.

When running on a platform with Istio network service mesh, the dynamic admission controller will be installed into the default namespace, and MUST NOT have Istio injection enabled. The certification image MUST be installed in a non-default namespace with Istio injecton enabled.

### [](#examples)Examples

```console
# Run platform certification with defaults
cao certify

# Run platform certification with a custom storage class
cao certify -storage-class my-class

# Run platform certification with private image repository
cao certify --registry=https://index.docker.io/v1/,username,password

## [](#cao-collect-logs-flags)cao collect-logs \[flags\]

Log and resource collection for Couchbase Autonomous Operator support.

When you encounter a problem with the Autonomous Operator, our support teams require more than just the last line of the logs to diagnose and, ultimately, resolve the issue quickly.

Log collection, in its most basic form, collects all resources associated with the Autonomous Operator and Couchbase clusters in the specified namespace, this includes associated logs and events. Most resource types are filtered, so the tool collects only what is necessary. Where filtering is not possible, all instances of that resource are collected, so it may be desirable to segregate the Autonomous Operator into its own namespace. Secrets, for example, are not filtered, but the tool redacts values, so if your support request relates to TLS, you may need to manually collect these resources and include them in your support request.

### [](#collected-resources)Collected Resources

Creates Couchbase Autonomous Operator components

## [](#cao-create-admission-flags)cao create admission \[flags\]

Creates the dynamic admission controller.

The DAC is designed to be deployed at the cluster scope (default). It monitors Couchbase resources as they are created and modified, accepting, or rejecting them, before they are persisted in etcd.

Use of the DAC is encouraged as it will report any configuration errors that are specific to deployment of Couchbase resources that aren't available by default in the Kubernetes API. For example, this includes validating memory quotas are satisfiable, TLS certificates are correctly configured, and any resources referenced actually exist.

## [](#cao-generate)cao generate

Generates YAML manifests for various Operator components

## [](#cao-generate-admission-flags)cao generate admission \[flags\]

Generates YAML for the dynamic admission controller.

The DAC is designed to be deployed at the cluster scope (default). It monitors Couchbase resources as they are created and modified, accepting, or rejecting them, before they are persisted in etcd.

Use of the DAC is encouraged as it will report any configuration errors that are specific to deployment of Couchbase resources that aren't available by default in the Kubernetes API. For example, this includes validating memory quotas are satisfiable, TLS certificates are correctly configured, and any resources referenced actually exist.

## [](#cao-restore-flags)cao restore \[flags\]

Restore a cluster's data topology

In a development environment it may be desirable to manually manage the data topology in a rapid and agile fashion, rather than use the native Kubernetes resource types we provide. For example you may wish to create buckets, scopes and collections using the UI, or an SDK, without having the overhead of change control, review and auditing of changes that using native resources would provide.

This command allows existing save data (as generated by 'cao save') to be applied to the selected cluster. Restoration of data topology occurs as follows: the Couchbase cluster is interrogated for all data topology (including unmanaged buckets, scopes and collections). This is then compared with the contents of the save data to detect resources that will be added, updated or deleted as a result of this restore operation. The user will be prompted for confimation that the outcome is as desired, giving you an opportunity to back out of unintentionally destructive operations.

A new, full tree of resources (buckets, scopes and collections) is created then atomically swapped with the old tree, providing roll back in the event of an error. Finally any old Kubernetes resources are automatically cleaned up.

The atomic swap of resources is performed using label selectors, allowing restores when multiple Couchbase clusters are running in the same namespace. As a precaution, the tool will only function if your cluster's buckets are unmanaged, there is no label selector set and there are no existing resources, or a label selector is already in use. It is your reponsibility to ensure that when multiple Couchbase clusters are running in the same namespace, they will not be affected by a restore operation e.g. they are not sharing any resources that may be modified or deleted. It is usually safest to run a single Couchbase cluster per-namespace.

All resources discovered when polling the Couchbase cluster will be backed by a Kubernetes resource, and managed by the Operator after a restore. You may manually disable management of a particular bucket or scope if you so wish.

Save and restore of resources will modify Kubernetes resources, so therefore should never be used with any other form of lifecycle management tool (e.g. Helm or Red Hat OLM) as these may revert changes and lead to catastrophic data loss.

### [](#examples-9)Examples

```console
# Restore the full data topology on the only cluster in a namespace
cao restore -f save-data.yaml

# Restore the full data topology to the specific cluster
cao restore --couchbase-cluster squirrel -f save-data.yaml

# Restore all scope and collections in a bucket
cao restore --path /bucket -f save-data.yaml

# Restore all collections in a scope
cao restore --path /bucket/scope -f save-data.yaml
```

### [](#flags-11)Flags

**Default**: /

Path restore data to. Default will restore all buckets, scopes and collections. '/bucket' will restore all scopes and collection in Couchbase bucket 'bucket'. '/bucket/scope' will restore all collections in Couchbase bucket 'bucket' and Couchbase scope 'scope'.

\--strategy

**Type**: string

**Default**: merge

Strategy to use when merging the save data with the current cluster's data. When 'merge', this will retain any existing items that are in the current cluster, but not in the save. When 'replace', this will fully replace the existing items that exist in the current cluster, but don't exist in the save. Merging protects the user from accidental data loss, whereas replacement may cause data loss, but ensures old data is purged to enforce data retention policies. This flag defaults to 'merge'.

## [](#cao-save-flags)cao save \[flags\]

Save a cluster's data topology

In a development environment it may be desirable to manually manage the data topology in a rapid and agile fashion, rather than use the native Kubernetes resource types we provide. For example you may wish to create buckets, scopes and collections using the UI, or an SDK, without having the overhead of change control, review and auditing of changes that using native resources would provide.

This command allows a specific cluster to be probed and all data topology resources saved, direct from the Couchbase cluster. Saved data topology represents data as Kubernetes native resource types and can later be used to restore data topology, allow it to be managed by the Operator, or even replicated to a completely new cluster.

Save and restore of resources will modify Kubernetes resources, so therefore should never be used with any other form of lifecycle management tool (e.g. Helm or Red Hat OLM) as these may revert changes and lead to catastrophic data loss.
