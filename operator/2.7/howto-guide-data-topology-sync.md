# How-to Guide: Data Topology Synchronization

> A how-to guide on data topology synchronization with Couchbase Autonomous Operator. 

## [](#overview)Overview

In the following guide, we’ll show you how to discover the configuration of a Couchbase cluster in the form of Kubernetes resources, and how the Autonomous Operator manages those resources.

## [](#prerequisites)Prerequisites

* If you are new to Couchbase Autonomous Operator (CAO), refer to the [Autonomous Operator Introduction](overview.md)
* Couchbase Scopes and Collections was added in Version 7.0\. Refer to the [Couchbase Scopes and Collections](concept-scopes-and-collections.md) page to learn more about these.

In your Couchbase cluster load the `travel-sample` sample bucket. See [Load the Sample Dataset](../../server/current/getting-started/do-a-quick-install.md#load-the-sample-dataset) to learn how to load a sample bucket.

On this cluster we’ll enable synchronization to discover the bucket and its scopes and collections in the form of Kubernetes resources.

> [!NOTE]
> For the purposes of this guide, we’ll be referring to an example cluster called `cb-example`. Substitute the name of the cluster with your own if necessary.

## [](#enabling-synchronization)Enabling Synchronization

In order to enable the synchronization, firstly we have to disable bucket management in the cluster. This is to ensure that existing configuration is not deleted once backing resources are removed.

```console
$ kubectl patch couchbasecluster cb-example --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"buckets":{"managed":false}}}'
```

The above command disables bucket management for a Couchbase cluster named `cb-example`.

Next, remove any resources that may conflict with those the Operator will generate.

```console
$ for i in couchbasebuckets \
    couchbaseephemeralbuckets \
    couchbasememcachedbuckets \
    couchbasescopes \
    couchbasescopegroups \
    couchbasecollections \
    couchbasecollectiongroups
  do
    kubectl delete $i --all
  done
```

This command deletes all resources in the namespace that will be affected by a synchronization operation. You can replace `--all` with a label, or field, selector if you wish to be more selective, especially in the case where multiple Couchbase clusters are running in the same namespace.

> [!WARNING]
> Data topology resources can be [shared between clusters](concept-label-selection.md). If they are shared, then deletion may affect another — unrelated — cluster and result in data loss. For this reason we recommend only ever deploying one Couchbase cluster per namespace.

## [](#synchronizing)Synchronizing

Once you have manually updated the data topology to how you want it, we can begin synchronizing it so it can be managed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because multiple Couchbase clusters can run in the same namespace, there is a danger that any resource created by synchronization may be erroneously picked up by another cluster. For this reason, the Operator enforces the use of a label selector to generate and select buckets for inclusion on the cluster to be synchronized. It is your responsibility to ensure any other clusters in this namespace have a unique bucket label selector that will not be affected by this synchronization operation.

Synchronization is triggered by first setting a label selector, then triggering the operation:

```console
$ kubectl patch couchbasecluster cb-example --type merge -p '{"spec":{"buckets":{"selector":{"matchLabels":{"foo":"bar"}}}}}'

$ kubectl patch couchbasecluster cb-example --type merge -p '{"spec":{"buckets":{"synchronize":true}}}'
```

After the above commands, the Operator will begin the synchronization process and it may take some time depending on the number of resources to synchronize.

The synchronization operation proceeds as follows:

1. Couchbase server is polled for all buckets, scopes and collections.
2. Kubernetes resources are generated for those Couchbase resources.

  1. Buckets are labeled as defined by the provided label selector, therefore they should be considered by this cluster only.
3. Kubernetes resources are created and persisted.
4. The Operator reports the status in the cluster conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once synchronization has been triggered, you should not make any more manual adjustments to the data topology. Doing so may result in a conflict between what is expected and what has already been generated and committed. If you do encounter a conflict, then restart the process from the [Enabling Synchronization](#enabling-synchronization) stage to remove the conflicting resource.

To check for completion status, you can wait until the condition is reported:

```console
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Synchronized couchbasecluster/cb-example
```

Once the synchronization is complete you’ll see the below output:

Result

```console
couchbasecluster.couchbase.com/cb-example condition met
```

Additionally, you can check whether or not the synchronization succeeded.

```console
$ kubectl describe couchbasecluster/cb-example | grep Synchronized -B 5
```

Result

```console
Last Transition Time:  2022-04-06T09:09:29Z
Last Update Time:      2022-04-06T09:09:29Z
Message:               Data topology synchronized and ready to be managed
Reason:                SynchronizationComplete
Status:                True
Type:                  Synchronized
```

From the above command output, we can see the synchronization is completed.

To verify this, we can check the `couchbasebuckets`, `couchbasescopes`, and `couchbasecollections` resources in the Kubernetes cluster.

* couchbasebuckets
* couchbasescopes
* couchbasecollections

```console
$ kubectl get couchbasebuckets
```

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike save and restore, synchronization does not optimize the data topology Kubernetes resources. In a worst case scenario, where 1000’s of scopes and collections are in use, then you can expect synchronization to take several minutes due to the throttling of requests to the Kubernetes API to ensure fair use.

## [](#managing-synchronized-resources)Managing Synchronized Resources

You must ensure synchronization has completed successfully before switching to managed mode. Failure to do so may result in backing resources not being created, and data loss.

Now that we have confirmed synchronization has completed successfully, we can switch the cluster’s bucket management on:

```console
$ kubectl patch couchbasecluster cb-example --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"buckets":{"synchronize":false,"managed":true}}}'
```

From this point onward, any managed resources that are deleted or modified manually will be recovered, and any additional resources that are added will be deleted, as per the usual operation of the Operator.

### [](#scenarios)Scenarios

#### [](#oops-scenario)Oops Scenario

Let’s check the scopes of the `travel-sample` bucket first. In the image below, we can see that there are a total of 7 scopes in this bucket.

![data topology synchronized resources](_images/data-topology-synchronized-resources.png) 

Let’s assume a scenario where we deleted one of the scopes (`tenant_agent_00`) by mistake. If the resource was synchronized, the operator should be able to recover it.

![data topology synchronized drop scope](_images/data-topology-synchronized-drop-scope.png) 

In the above image we are deleting the `tenant_agent_00` scope and after some time, the Operator should recover it.

![data topology synchronized deleted scope](_images/data-topology-synchronized-deleted-scope.png) 

In order to see if the resources are recovered or not, we can look at the events of the `CouchbaseCluster` resource.

```console
$ kubectl describe couchbaseclusters cb-example
```

Result

```console
Events:
  Type    Reason                            Age   From  Message
  ----    ------                            ----  ----  -------
  Normal  NewMemberAdded                    52m         New member cb-example-0000 added to cluster
  Normal  NewMemberAdded                    52m         New member cb-example-0001 added to cluster
  Normal  NewMemberAdded                    52m         New member cb-example-0002 added to cluster
  Normal  RebalanceStarted                  52m         A rebalance has been started to balance data across the cluster
  Normal  RebalanceCompleted                52m         A rebalance has completed
  Normal  EventScopesAndCollectionsUpdated  38m         Scopes and collections updated for bucket travel-sample
```

Here, we have just copied the output of events from the above command. The last event says scopes and collections are updated for the bucket.

This means the operator has recovered the resource and we can verify the same on Couchbase UI.
