# ADVISOR Function

The ADVISOR function provides index recommendations to optimize query response time. There are two main scenarios for using this function. One is to invoke the index advisor _immediately_ for a given query or set of queries; the other is to start a session in which every query of interest is collected for a set time period, then invoke the index advisor _asynchronously_ for that collection of queries when the session ends. Within these two scenarios, this function has several different usages. The operation and output of each usage depends on the function’s single argument. For clarity, each usage is listed separately on this page.

## [](#advisor-string)ADVISOR(`string`)

### [](#description)Description

When used with a string argument, the function invokes the index advisor for a single SQL++ query. The index advisor works with [SELECT](selectintro.md), [UPDATE](update.md), [DELETE](delete.md), or [MERGE](merge.md) queries.

### [](#arguments)Arguments

string

A string, or an expression which resolves to a string, containing a single SQL++ query.

### [](#return-value)Return Value

Returns an index advisor results object with the following properties.

### [](#example)Example

To try the examples in this section, set the query context to the `inventory` scope in the travel sample dataset. For more information, see [Query Context](../n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.md#query-context).

Get index advice for a single query

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT ADVISOR("SELECT * FROM landmark
WHERE activity = 'eat' AND city = 'Paris'") AS Single;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "Single": {
      "current_used_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX def_inventory_landmark_city ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`landmark`(`city`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark\nWHERE activity = 'eat' AND city = 'Paris'"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "recommended_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_city_activity ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`landmark`(`city`,`activity`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark\nWHERE activity = 'eat' AND city = 'Paris'"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

Only one statement occurs in these results, because the function was called with a single query input. In this case, the index advisor identifies one index which is currently used by the query, and recommends one secondary index. No covering indexes are recommended.

## [](#advisor-array)ADVISOR(`array`)

### [](#description-2)Description

When used with an array argument, the function invokes the index advisor for multiple SQL++ queries. The index advisor works with [SELECT](selectintro.md), [UPDATE](update.md), [DELETE](delete.md), or [MERGE](merge.md) queries.

### [](#arguments-2)Arguments

array

An array of strings, or an expression which resolves to an array of strings, each of which contains a SQL++ query.

### [](#return-value-2)Return Value

Returns an [index advisor results](#results) object.

### [](#examples)Examples

To try the examples in this section, set the query context to the `inventory` scope in the travel sample dataset. For more information, see [Query Context](../n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.md#query-context).

Get index advice for multiple queries

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT ADVISOR([
  "SELECT * FROM landmark
   WHERE activity = 'eat' AND city = 'Paris'",
  "SELECT * FROM landmark
   WHERE activity = 'see' AND city = 'San Francisco'"
]) AS Multiple;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "Multiple": {
      "current_used_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX def_inventory_landmark_city ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`landmark`(`city`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark\n   WHERE activity = 'eat' AND city = 'Paris'"
            },
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark\n   WHERE activity = 'see' AND city = 'San Francisco'"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "recommended_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_city_activity ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`landmark`(`city`,`activity`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark\n   WHERE activity = 'eat' AND city = 'Paris'"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_activity_city ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`landmark`(`activity`,`city`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark\n   WHERE activity = 'see' AND city = 'San Francisco'"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

In this case, the index advisor recommends an index which would be suitable for both of the input queries.

Get index advice for recent completed requests

This example uses a subquery to get an array of statements from the [system:completed\_requests](../n1ql-manage/monitoring-n1ql-query.md#sys-completed-req) catalog.

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT ADVISOR((SELECT RAW statement FROM system:completed_requests)) AS Recent;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "Recent": {
      "current_used_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE PRIMARY INDEX def_inventory_route_primary ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`route`",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 3,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route r JOIN `travel-sample`.inventory.airline a ON r.airlineid= META(a).id WHERE a.country = \"France\";"
            },
            {
              "run_count": 2,
              "statement": "SELECT d.id, d.destinationairport, RATIO_TO_REPORT(d.distance) OVER (PARTITION BY d.destinationairport) AS `distance-ratio` FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route AS d LIMIT 7;"
            },
// ...
          ]
        },
        {
          "index": "CREATE PRIMARY INDEX def_inventory_airport_primary ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`airport`",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airport WHERE geo.alt NOT BETWEEN 0 AND 100;"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "recommended_covering_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_geo_alt_airportname ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`airport`(`geo`.`alt`,`airportname`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airport WHERE geo.alt NOT BETWEEN 0 AND 100;"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "recommended_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_geo_alt ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`airport`(`geo`.`alt`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airport WHERE geo.alt NOT BETWEEN 0 AND 100;"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_airlineid ON `default`:`travel-sample`.`inventory`.`route`(`airlineid`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 3,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route r JOIN `travel-sample`.inventory.airline a ON r.airlineid= META(a).id WHERE a.country = \"France\";"
            }
// ...
```

In this case, the index advisor recommends several covering indexes and secondary indexes, each of which would be suitable for multiple recent queries. (Results are truncated for brevity.)

## [](#advisor-session-start)ADVISOR(`start_obj`)

### [](#description-3)Description

When used with a `start_obj` object argument, the function can be used to start an index advisor session. As long as the session is running, any queries that meet the criteria you specify are collected for later analysis.

By default, the session continues running for the duration you specify when you start the session. At the end of the duration, the index advisor analyzes any queries that have been collected by this session. The session and any resulting index advice are retained in the _tasks cache_. You can then [get the results](#advisor-session-get) for this session to see the index advice.

### [](#arguments-3)Arguments

start\_obj

An object with the following properties:

action

\[Required\] The string `start`.

profile

\[Optional\] A string specifying the user profile whose queries you want to collect. If omitted, all queries are collected.

response

\[Optional\] A string representing a duration. All completed queries lasting longer than this threshold are collected for analysis by the index advisor. Valid time units are `ns` (nanoseconds), `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), or `h` (hours). If omitted, the default setting is `0s`.

duration

\[Required\] A string representing a duration. The index advisor session runs for the length of this duration. Valid time units are `ns` (nanoseconds), `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), or `h` (hours).

query\_count

\[Optional\] An integer specifying the maximum number of queries to be collected for analysis by the index advisor. If omitted, the default setting is the same as the service-level [completed-limit](../n1ql-manage/query-settings.md#completed-limit) setting. You can change the service-level `completed-limit` setting to change the default for this property.

### [](#return-value-3)Return Value

Returns an object with the following property:

| Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Schema        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **session** _required_ | The name of the index advisor session. You will need to refer to this name to [get the results](#advisor-session-get) for this session, or to [stop](#advisor-session-stop), [abort](#advisor-session-abort), or [purge](#advisor-session-purge) this session. | string (UUID) |

### [](#example-2)Example

Start an index advisor session

The following example starts an index advisor session to run for one hour. All completed queries taking longer than 0 seconds will be collected.

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT ADVISOR({"action": "start", "response": "0s", "duration": "1h"}) AS Collect;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "Collect": {
      "session": "0cd09ae4-a083-4a7e-86cd-85e42c140d60"
    }
  }
]
```

## [](#advisor-session-list)ADVISOR(`list_obj`)

### [](#description-4)Description

When used with a `list_obj` object argument, the function can be used to list index advisor sessions. Each index advisor session is stored as a scheduled task in the [system:tasks\_cache](../n1ql-manage/monitoring-n1ql-query.md#sys-tasks-cache) catalog.

### [](#arguments-4)Arguments

list\_obj

An object with the following properties:

action

\[Required\] The string `list`.

status

\[Optional\] A string specifying the status of the index advisor sessions to list. This must be one of the following:

* `completed` — only list completed sessions
* `active` — only list active sessions
* `all` — list all sessions

If omitted, the default is `all`.

### [](#return-value-4)Return Value

## [](#advisor-session-stop)ADVISOR(`stop_obj`)

### [](#description-5)Description

When used with a `stop_obj` object argument, the function can be used to stop an index advisor session. In this case, the session is stopped, and the index advisor analyzes any queries that have been collected by this session so far. The session and any resulting index advice are retained in the tasks cache. You can then [get the results](#advisor-session-get) for this session to see the index advice.

### [](#arguments-5)Arguments

stop\_obj

An object with the following properties:

action

\[Required\] The string `stop`.

session

\[Required\] A string specifying the name of a session.

### [](#return-value-5)Return Value

Returns an empty array.
