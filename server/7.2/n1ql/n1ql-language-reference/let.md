# LET clause

> Use `LET` to create variables for later use within a query. 

## [](#purpose)Purpose

In a query expression, it is sometimes useful to store the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses. You can do this with the `LET` keyword, which creates a new variable and initializes it with the result of the expression you supply. You can use the `LET` clause within an array, in a for-loop, or independently.

Without the `LET` clause, your complex queries would need to be divided into two separate queries:

* One query to get a particular value (or set of values), and
* One query to use the value (or values) from the first query.

If the `LET` variable is referenced in the `WHERE` clause, then it is evaluated before the `WHERE` clause; otherwise, it is evaluated after the `WHERE` clause.

Couchbase Server 6.5 and later supports chained `LET` clauses. A variable that you create in one `LET` clause may be referenced in a later `LET` clause, as detailed in [Example 3](#ex3).

Each `LET` alias needs to be unique within its scope.

## [](#prerequisites)Prerequisites

The `LET` clause can only be used in a `SELECT` statement, and in order for you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the `query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace. For more details about user roles, see [Authorization](../../learn/security/authorization-overview.md).

## [](#syntax)Syntax

```ebnf
let-clause ::= 'LET' alias '=' expr ( ',' alias '=' expr )*
```

![Syntax diagram](../_images/n1ql-language-reference/let-clause.png) 

## [](#arguments)Arguments

alias

\[Required\] [Identifier](identifiers.md) that represents the name of the variable.

expr

\[Required\] [Expression](index.md#N1QL%5FExpressions) that represents the value assigned to its `alias`.

## [](#examples%5Fsection)Examples

To try the examples in this section, set the query context to the `inventory` scope in the travel sample dataset. For more information, see [Query Context](../n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.md#query-context).

Example 1\. Use LET to set variables to a number, an operation on a field, and a subquery

Find all airports and cities between certain latitudes in a country with a landmark.

```sqlpp
SELECT t1.airportname, t1.geo.lat, t1.geo.lon, t1.city, t1.type
FROM airport t1
LET min_lat = 71, max_lat = ABS(t1.geo.lon)*4+1,
    place = (SELECT RAW t2.country
            FROM landmark t2)
WHERE t1.geo.lat > min_lat
AND t1.geo.lat < max_lat
AND t1.country IN place;
```

Results

```JSON
[
  {
    "airportname": "Wiley Post Will Rogers Mem",
    "city": "Barrow",
    "lat": 71.285446,
    "lon": -156.766003,
    "type": "airport"
  },
  {
    "airportname": "Dillant Hopkins Airport",
    "city": "Keene",
    "lat": 72.270833,
    "lon": 42.898333,
    "type": "airport"
  }
]
```

Example 2\. Use LET to set a variable in an array

Find all Sunday flights (`day = 0`) to the Charles De Gaulle airport (`CDG`) on Air India (`AI`) airlines.

```sqlpp
SELECT t1.airline, t1.destinationairport, sch AS schedule
FROM route AS t1
LET sch = ARRAY v FOR v IN t1.schedule WHEN v.day = 0 END (1)
WHERE t1.destinationairport = "CDG"
AND t1.airline = "AI";
```

| **1** | In this example, the variable sch is not used in the WHERE clause, but used only in the projection. Therefore, the Query Planner defers the evaluation to post-predicate evaluation, so there is no overhead for documents that are not qualified by the predicates. |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Results

```JSON
[
  {
    "airline": "AI",
    "destinationairport": "CDG",
    "schedule": [
      {
        "day": 0,
        "flight": "AI988",
        "utc": "00:24:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 0,
        "flight": "AI972",
        "utc": "17:32:00"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Example 3\. Use chained LET

Variant of [Example 1](#ex1).

```sqlpp
SELECT t1.airportname, t1.geo.lat, t1.geo.lon, t1.city, t1.type
FROM airport t1
LET max_lat = ABS(t1.geo.lon)*4+1, (1)
    min_lat = max_lat - 90, (2)
    place = (SELECT RAW t2.country
            FROM landmark t2)
WHERE t1.geo.lat > min_lat
AND t1.geo.lat < max_lat
AND t1.country IN place;
```

| **1** | The variable max\_lat is defined in the first clause of the LET statement.                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2** | The variable max\_lat is referenced by the min\_lat variable in the second clause of the LET statement. |

Results

```JSON
[
  {
    "airportname": "Wideawake Field",
    "city": "Georgetown Acension Island Santa Helena",
    "lat": -7.969597,
    "lon": -14.393664,
    "type": "airport"
  }
]
