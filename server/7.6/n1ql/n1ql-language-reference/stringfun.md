# String Functions

String functions perform operations on a string input value and returns a string or other value.

> [!NOTE]
> If any arguments to any of the following functions are `MISSING` then the result is also `MISSING` — that is, no result is returned. Similarly, if any of the arguments passed to the functions are `NULL` or are of the wrong type, such as an integer instead of a string, then `NULL` is returned as the result.

## [](#fn-str-concat)CONCAT(`string1`, `string2`, …)

### [](#description)Description

This function takes two or more strings and returns a new string after concatenating the input strings. If there are fewer than two arguments, then it returns an error.

### [](#arguments)Arguments

string1, string2, ...

\[At least 2 are required\] The strings, or valid [expressions](index.md) which evaluate to strings, to be concatenated together.

### [](#return-value)Return Value

A new string, concatenated from the input strings.

### [](#examples)Examples

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT CONCAT("abc", "def", "ghi") AS concat;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "concat": "abcdefghi"
  }
]
```

## [](#fn-str-concat2)CONCAT2(`separator`, `arg1`, `arg2`, …)

### [](#description-2)Description

This function takes the input strings, or arrays of strings, and concatenates them with the specified separator between each input string. If there are fewer than two arguments, then it returns an error.

### [](#arguments-2)Arguments

separator

\[Required\] The string to separate the input strings. If no separator is required, specify the empty string "".

arg1, arg2, ...

\[At least 1 is required\] The strings, or arrays of strings, to be concatenated together.

### [](#return-value-2)Return Value

A new string, concatenated from the inputs, with the separator between each input. Arrays of strings are flattened and concatenated in the same order. If there is only one string argument, the separator is not used.

If any argument or array element is MISSING, returns MISSING. If any argument or array element is non-string, returns NULL.

### [](#examples-2)Examples

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT CONCAT2('-','a','b',['c','d'],['xyz']) AS c1,
CONCAT2('-','a') AS c2,
CONCAT2('-',['b']) AS c3;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "c1": "a-b-c-d-xyz",
    "c2": "a",
    "c3": "b"
  }
]
```

## [](#fn-str-contains)CONTAINS(in\_str, search\_str)

### [](#description-3)Description

Checks whether or not the specified search string is a substring of the input string — that is, exists within. This returns `true` if the substring exists within the input string, otherwise `false` is returned.

### [](#arguments-3)Arguments

in\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search within.

search\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search for.

### [](#return-value-3)Return Value

A boolean, representing whether the search string exists within the input string.

### [](#examples-3)Examples

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT CONTAINS("SQL++ is awesome", "N1QL") as n1ql,
       CONTAINS("SQL++ is awesome", "SQL") as sql;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "n1ql": false,
    "sql": true
  }
]
```

## [](#fn-str-initcap)INITCAP(in\_str)

### [](#description-4)Description

Converts the string so that the first letter of each word is uppercase and every other letter is lowercase (known as 'Title Case').

### [](#arguments-4)Arguments

in\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that is the string to convert to title case.

### [](#return-value-4)Return Value

A string, representing the input string converted to title case.

### [](#limitations)Limitations

This function capitalizes the initial letter of every word in the sentence, this means that even short words such as "the" and "or" will be capitalized. This does not strictly follow title case conventions used in the writing domain.

### [](#examples-4)Examples

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT INITCAP("SQL++ is awesome") as sqlpp;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "sqlpp": "Sql++ Is Awesome"
  }
]
```

## [](#fn-str-length)LENGTH(in\_str)

_Equivalent_: [LEN()](metafun.md#len)

### [](#description-5)Description

Finds the length of a string, where length is defined as the number of code points within the string.

This function works with single bytes, not multi-byte characters. For a variant of this function that works with multi-byte characters, see [MB\_LENGTH()](#fn-mb-length).

### [](#arguments-5)Arguments

in\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that is the string to find the length of.

### [](#return-value-5)Return Value

An integer representing the length of the string.

### [](#examples-5)Examples

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT LENGTH("SQL++ is awesome") AS ascii,
       LENGTH("Café") AS diacritic,
       LENGTH("🙂") AS emoji,
       LENGTH("") AS zero;
```

| **1** | The letter with diacritic counts as two bytes. |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **2** | The emoji counts as four bytes.                |

## [](#fn-str-lower)LOWER(in\_str)

### [](#description-6)Description

Converts all characters in the input string to lower case. This is useful for canonical comparison of string values.

### [](#arguments-6)Arguments

in\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that is the string to convert to lower case.

### [](#return-value-6)Return Value

    "sqlpp": "sql++ is awesome"
  }
]
```

## [](#fn-str-lpad)LPAD(in\_str, size \[, char\])

### [](#description-7)Description

Pads a string with leading characters. The function adds characters to the beginning of the string to pad the string to a specified length.

This function works with single bytes, not multi-byte characters. For a variant of this function that works with multi-byte characters, see [MB\_LPAD()](#fn-mb-lpad).

### [](#arguments-7)Arguments

in\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that is the string to add the leading characters to.

size

An integer, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to an integer, that specifies the desired length of the result string.

char

\[Optional\] A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that represents the characters to add to the input string.

If omitted, the default is space `" "`, Unicode U+0020.

### [](#return-value-7)Return Value

A string representing the input string with leading characters added.

* If the specified size is smaller than the length of the input string, the input string is truncated and no padding is added.
* If the specified size is larger than the length of the input string, but shorter than the length of the input string plus the padding characters, the padding characters are truncated.
* If the specified size is greater than the length of the input string plus the padding characters, the padding characters are repeated in order until the specified size is reached.

### [](#examples-7)Examples

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT LPAD("SQL++ is awesome", 20) AS implicit_padding,
       LPAD("SQL++ is awesome", 20, "🙂!") AS repeated_padding,
       LPAD("SQL++ is awesome", 20, "987654321") AS truncate_padding,
       LPAD("SQL++ is awesome", 5, "987654321") AS truncate_string;
```

```json
[
  {
    "implicit_padding": "    SQL++ is awesome",
    "repeated_padding": "🙂SQL++ is awesome", (1)
    "truncate_padding": "9876SQL++ is awesome",
    "truncate_string": "SQL++"
  }
]
```

| **1** | The emoji counts as four bytes when calculating the size. |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |

## [](#fn-str-ltrim)LTRIM(in\_str \[, char\])

### [](#description-8)Description

Removes all leading characters from a string. The function removes all consecutive characters from the beginning of the string that match the specified characters and stops when it encounters a character that does not match any of the specified characters.

### [](#arguments-8)Arguments

in\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that is the string to remove the leading characters from.

char

\[Optional\] A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that represents the characters to trim from the input string. Each character in this string is trimmed from the input string — you don’t need to delimit the characters to trim. For example, specifying a character value of `"abc"` trims the characters "a", "b" and "c" from the start of the string.

If omitted, the default is whitespace: space `" "`, tab `"\t"`, newline `"\n"`, formfeed `"\f"`, or carriage return `"\r"`.

### [](#return-value-8)Return Value

A string representing the input string with leading characters removed.

### [](#examples-8)Examples

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT LTRIM("...SQL++ is awesome", ".") as dots,
       LTRIM("     SQL++ is awesome", " ") as explicit_spaces,

    "no_dots": "SQL++ is awesome"
  }
]
```

## [](#fn-str-mask)MASK(in\_str \[, options\])

### [](#description-9)Description

Overlays specified characters in the string with masking characters. This may be useful when returning sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or email addresses.

### [](#arguments-9)Arguments

in\_str

A string, or any valid [expression](index.md) which evaluates to a string, that represents the string to mask.

options

An object containing the following possible parameters:

mask

A string containing masking characters that will be used to overlay the input string. May optionally also contain _hole_ characters, representing gaps in the mask; and _inject_ characters, that are inserted into the output. (Default: `********`)

hole

A string containing the character or characters used to indicate holes in the mask string. (Default: space)

inject

A string containing the character or characters in the mask string that are inserted into the output, rather than overlaying the input. (Default: none)

length

Determines the length of the output string. (Default: missing)

* If this property is missing, or set to anything other than `"source"`, the length of the output is dynamic. Any characters in the input up to the anchor point (see below) are included in the output. The mask then starts at the anchor point, and continues for the length of the specified mask string. Any characters in the input beyond the end of the mask are deleted. This method may therefore obscure the number of characters in the input.
* If the value is `"source"`, the length of the output is the same as the length of the input. Any characters in the input up to the anchor point are included in the output. The mask then starts at the anchor point. If the mask is _longer than_ the remaining length of the input, the mask is truncated to fit. If the mask string is _shorter than or the same length as_ the remaining length of the input, the mask continues for the length of the specified mask string. Any characters in the input beyond the end of the mask are included in the output.

anchor

Determines where in the input string the mask should start. Possible values are `"start"`, `"end"`, a regular expression string, a positive integer, or a negative integer. (Default: `"start"`)

* `"start"` — the mask begins at the start of the input and is applied towards the end.
* `"end"` — the mask begins at the end of the input and is applied from the end towards the start.
* Regular expression — the mask begins at the first point in the input which matches the regular expression, and is applied towards the end. If you need to match the strings `"start"` or `"end"`, use patterns such as `"[s]tart"` or `"[e]nd"`.
* Positive integer — the mask begins the specified number of characters after the start of the input, and is applied towards the end.
* Negative integer — the mask begins the specified number of characters before the end of the input, and is applied towards the start.

If an anchor places the mask outside the boundaries of the input string, the input string is returned unchanged.

### [](#return-value-9)Return Value

A string representing the masked input string.

### [](#examples-9)Examples

Default mask, custom mask, custom mask demonstrating holes.

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT MASK('SomeTextToMask') AS mask,
       MASK('SomeTextToMask', {"mask": "++++"}) AS mask_custom,
       MASK('SomeTextToMask', {"mask": "++++    ++++"}) AS mask_hole;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "mask": "********",
    "mask_custom": "++++",
    "mask_hole": "++++Text++++"
  }
]
```

```sqlpp
SELECT MASK('1234abcd5678efgh', {"mask": "****-****-****-####",
                                 "hole": "#",
                                 "inject": "-"}) AS mask_inject;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "mask_inject": "****-****-****-efgh"
  }
]
```

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT MASK('1234abcd5678efgh', {"mask": "****", "anchor": "end", "length": "source"})
AS end_anchor;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "end_anchor": "1234abcd5678****"
  }
]
```

Mask anchored at the pattern `d5`.

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT MASK('1234abcd5678efgh', {"mask": "****", "anchor": "d5"}) AS regex_anchor;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "regex_anchor": "1234abc****"
  }
]
```

Query

```sqlpp
SELECT MASK('1234abcd5678efgh', {"mask": "****", "anchor": -2, "length": "source"})
AS negative_anchor;
```

Result

```json
[
  {
    "negative_anchor": "1234abcd56****gh"
  }
]
```

Mask anchored at the 14th character, with length determined by the input string.

```sqlpp
SELECT MASK('1234abcd5678efgh', {"mask": "****", "anchor": 14, "length": "source"})
AS positive_anchor;
```

Result

## [](#fn-str-title)TITLE(in\_str)

Alias for [INITCAP()](#fn-str-initcap).

## [](#fn-str-token)TOKENS(in\_str, opt)

### [](#description-28)Description

This function tokenizes (i.e. breaks up into meaningful segments) the given input string based on specified delimiters, and other options. It recursively enumerates all tokens in a JSON value and returns an array of values (JSON atomic values) as the result.

### [](#arguments-28)Arguments

in\_str

A valid JSON object, this can be anything: constant literal, simple JSON value, JSON key name or the whole document itself.

The following table lists the rules for each JSON type:

| JSON Type | Return Value                                                                        |

| object    | For each name-value pair, name+TOKENS(value)                                        |

opt

A JSON object indicating the options passed to the `TOKENS()` function. Options can take the following options, and each invocation of `TOKENS()` can choose one or more of the options:

{"name": true}

**Optional**. Valid values are `true` or `false`. By default, this is set to true and `TOKENS()` will include field names. You can choose to not include field names by setting this option to `false`.

{"case":"lower"}

**Optional**. Valid values are `lower` or `upper`. Default is neither, as in it returns the case of the original data. Use this option to specify the case sensitivity.

{"specials": true}

**Optional**. Use this option to preserve strings with specials characters, such as email addresses, URLs, and hyphenated phone numbers. The default value is `false`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `specials` options preserves special characters except at the end of a word.

### [](#return-value-28)Return Value

An array of strings containing all of the tokens obtained from the input string.

### [](#examples-28)Examples

> [!NOTE]
> By default, for speed, the results are randomly ordered. To make the difference more clear between the first two example queries, the `ARRAY_SORT()` function is used.

List the tokens of an array where `specials` is FALSE

```sqlpp
SELECT ARRAY_SORT(
  TOKENS( ['jim@example.com, kim@example.com, http://example.com/, 408-555-1212'],
          {'specials': false} ));
```

```json
[
  {
    "$1": [
      "1212",
      "408",
      "555",
      "abc",
      "com",
      "http",
      "jim",
      "kim"
    ]
  }
]
```

List the tokens of an array where `specials` is TRUE

```sqlpp
SELECT ARRAY_SORT(
  TOKENS( ['jim@example.com, kim@example.com, http://example.com/, 408-555-1212'],
          {'specials': true} ));
```

```json
[
  {
    "$1": [
      "1212",
      "408",
      "408-555-1212",
      "555",
      "abc",
      "com",
      "http",
      "http://example.com",
      "jim",
      "jim@example.com",
      "kim",
      "kim@example.com"
    ]
  }
]
```

Convert all of the URL data into UPPER case and adds the full URL to the delimited words

For this example, set the query context to the `inventory` scope in the travel sample dataset. For more information, see [Query Context](../n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.md#query-context).

```sqlpp
SELECT ARRAY_SORT( TOKENS(url) ) AS defaulttoken,
       ARRAY_SORT( TOKENS(url, {"specials":true, "case":"UPPER"}) ) AS specialtoken
FROM hotel
LIMIT 1;
```

```json
[
  {
    "defaulttoken": [
      "http",
      "org",
      "uk",
      "www",
      "yha"
    ],
    "specialtoken": [
      "HTTP",
      "HTTP://WWW.YHA.ORG.UK",
      "ORG",
      "UK",
      "WWW",
      "YHA"
    ]
  }
]
```

You can also use `{"case":"lower"}` or `{"case":"upper"}` to have case sensitive search. Index creation and querying can use this and other parameters in combination. These parameters should be passed within the query predicates as well. The parameters and values must match exactly for SQL++ to pick up and use the index correctly.

Create an index with `case` and use it your application

For this example, set the query context to the `inventory` scope in the travel sample dataset. For more information, see [Query Context](../n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.md#query-context).

```sqlpp
CREATE INDEX idx_url_upper_special ON hotel(
    DISTINCT ARRAY v FOR v IN
        TOKENS(url, {"specials":true, "case":"UPPER"})
    END );
```

```sqlpp
SELECT name, address, url
FROM hotel
WHERE ANY v IN TOKENS(url, {"specials":true, "case":"UPPER"})
      SATISFIES v = "HTTP://WWW.YHA.ORG.UK"
      END;
```

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "address": "Capstone Road, ME7 3JE",
            "name": "Medway Youth Hostel",
            "url": "http://www.yha.org.uk"
        }
    ]
}
```
